# Roganveshak AI

## Overview

Skin disease detection stands as a cornerstone in healthcare, especially within dermatology, owing to its profound impact on patient health and well-being. Timely and precise diagnosis of skin lesions is indispensable for effective treatment planning and disease management. This project introduces a sophisticated web application, Roganveshak AI, that utilizes advanced methodologies for the detection and classification of skin lesions, including both benign and malignant types such as melanoma.

## Features

- **Multi-Image Two-Stage Majority Voting Technique:** Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and YOLOv8 models for classifying pigmented skin lesions.
- **Quantum-Classical Stack Ensemble:** Integrating classical and quantum machine learning techniques for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
- **Interactive Client-Side Interface:** Facilitating user-friendly access and engagement with the diagnostic process.
- **High Accuracy:** The majority voting technique achieves an accuracy of 92%, while the quantum-classical stack ensemble method surpasses 90% accuracy.

## Objectives

- Enhance diagnostic accuracy for skin lesions.
- Streamline clinical workflows.
- Improve the quality of patient care through advanced diagnostic tools.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following key components:

1. **Server-Side Interface:**
   - Handles the core processing of images using CNN, YOLOv8, and quantum-classical stack ensemble models.
   - Manages the data flow between the client-side interface and the machine learning models.

2. **Client-Side Interface:**
   - Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to upload images and receive diagnostic results.
   - Displays the diagnostic outcomes and relevant information clearly and efficiently.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Use the client-side interface to upload images of skin lesions.
2. **Get Diagnosis:** The application processes the images using the implemented models and provides a diagnostic result.
3. **Review Results:** Review the results displayed on the interface, which include the classification and confidence level.
